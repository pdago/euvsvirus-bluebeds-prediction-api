This repository contains the implementation of the REST API that provides the ICU length-of-stay estimation. It is part
of the [BlueBeds](https://devpost.com/software/bluebeds) project and it was created during the
[EUvsVirus](https://euvsvirus.org/) hackaton.

The prediction model is taken from [here](https://github.com/rachelHey/versus-virus-hack-length-of-stay-prediction).
